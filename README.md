Domain:  FMCG       Function: Sales / Promotions

AtliQ Mart is a retail giant with over 50 supermarkets in the southern region of India.
All their 50 stores ran a massive promotion during the Diwali 2023 and Sankranti 2024 (festive time in India) on their AtliQ branded products. 
Now the sales director wants to understand which promotions did well and which did not so that they can make informed decisions for their next promotional period.  

Sales director wanted this immediately but the analytics manager  is engaged on another critical project.
Analytics Manager decided to give this work to Peter Pandey who is the curious data analyst of AtliQ Mart.
Since these insights will be directly reported to the sales director, Analytics Manager also provided some notes to Peter to support his work.
